Q2


A liquid mixture containing 50 mol \%  (A), 50 mol \% (B), at 30 C, is to be continuously flash-vaporized at 1 atm pressure to vaporize 60 mol \% of the feed. What will be the composition of the vapor and liquid and the temperature in the separator for an equilibrium stage?

The equilibrium plot can be obtained by following equation: 

$$y=\frac{\alpha x}{1+(\alpha-)x }$$
